# Pixel Art Maker Project
This was the second project of the Udacity Front End Developer Phase 1
The aim of the project was to exercise and to learn to work with javascript

#About

For this project, we are given a starter template. Using this template, I'm building the page to do the following:

Upon form submission, build the grid.
The form provides the number of rows (via the grid height) and columns (via the grid width).
The grid is a <table>.
Upon clicking on a single grid square, color that square's background color to the currently selected hex color.
Build it with JavaScript

## Contributing and instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.
But feel free to play around with it
